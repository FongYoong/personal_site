# What is it?

With all the buzz around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), I decided to give it a try by building, yes, another irrelevant e-commerce website
which accomodates both products (measured by quantity) and services (measured by hourly rate).
The landing page is basically filler promotional material to emphasise the website's brand.

Upon entering the marketplace page, users are greeted with listings of products and services filled with comical images and descriptions from my friends.
For each product, there's a summary coupled with reviews given by past customers. Orders can only be created by registered users.

Ordering a product/service is as straightforward as it gets, but the scheduling calendar can be unintuitive.

Both consumers and sellers can view their past or pending orders. Simple charts and tables summarize sales data for sellers.

Not only do users have their own profile page, they can easily chat with one another to negotiate business.

# Database Considerations
* [*Firebase*](https://firebase.google.com/) is the backend for authentication and user data.
Products, services
Chat
Feels harder in Firebase. Relational data
However, authorization provided out of the box


# Asset Storage
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is used to store any uploaded images or videos.
Cloudinary, CDN with fast upload and download speeds
secure with private key

# UI Design
Chakra UI
Hover over card to play video


# Framer Motion
To breathe interactivity in relevant elements


# Conclusions
How's Next.js etc
