# What is it?

After hearing lots of buzz around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), I decided to give it a try by building, yes, another irrelevant e-commerce website.
The landing page is basically filler promotional material to emphasise the website's brand.

Upon entering the marketplace page, you'll be greeted with listings of products and services filled with comical images and descriptions.

* Users can create 

* A mostly-static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site which enables users to buy and sell products/services in a democratic manner. The system is primitive in the sense that 'payments' are made at the click of a button lol. Users are also able to chat with one another privately.
* [*Firebase*](https://firebase.google.com/)** is the backend for authentication and user data.
* **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)** is used to store any uploaded images or videos.

# Database Considerations
Products, services
Chat
Feels harder in Firebase. Relational data
However, authorization provided out of the box


# Asset Storage
Cloudinary, CDN with fast upload and download speeds
secure with private key

# UI Design
Chakra UI
Hover over card to play video


# Framer Motion
To breathe interactivity in relevant elements


# Conclusions
