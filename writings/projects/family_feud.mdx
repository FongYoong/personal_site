# The Game
This is a React-based web app that implements a variation of the Family Feud game, which I developed for a group event.
What's great is it runs well as an offline standalone HTML file and comes with a preset of rounds. The images and sounds are all bundled inside the HTML file as encoded binary blobs.
<br />
As shown below, the rounds are editable/deleted/added etc. They are saved in the browser's local storage and can be also exported/reloaded as JSON files.

Below is how the gameplay would look like. Basically, it expects a presenter or host to control the progress, reveal the answer and allocate the points accordingly to the winning team.
There's also a lightning round with a timer where teams have to quickly guess the answer within the time limit.

To aid the host, the **Presenter** button spawns a separate window which can be hidden from the audience.
This presenter window shows the answers and points for normal rounds.
For lightning rounds, it shows the answers for each question (since presenter needs to decide whether the participant's answer is correct).
And to me, the coolest thing here is the previous/next buttons which control the rounds. It was exciting making this work using React Context.

Navigation was also made simple, with a popup modal that can jump around. There's also a FAQ and interactive tour that's not shown in the video.

# A Generator
[Generator Github repo](https://github.com/FongYoong/answer-battle-generator)

Given that the final game HTML file has a preset of rounds, it would be convenient to regenerate it with different preset rounds for better distribution to other game hosts.
So, I developed an Electron-based desktop GUI which enables hosts to specify metadata like webpage title, logo, theme sounds and most crucially, the rounds data.
The rounds data had to follow a certain text format, in order to determine info like normal/lightning round type, timer duration, points, description etc.
Using the [Monaco editor library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) (which powers VSCode as well), I was able to integrate linting capabilities so that users know whether the rounds data format is malformed.
Below is how it looks like:

When **Generate** is clicked, the program actually copies over these metadata to the React game project and builds the final HTML file with NPM.
And even more surreal to me at first, I managed to bundle NPM and Node itself into the Electron binary release so that users can generate the final HTML out of the box without manually installing NPM/Node (only tested on Windows).
