# What is it?
This was a [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as part of an evaluative assignment from [Intel Elite Internship](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2021/07/26/higher-education-ministry-intel-elite-internship-programme-meets-the-demand/1992770).
It uses [Tk](https://metacpan.org/dist/Tk/view/pod/UserGuide.pod) to create an interactive [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) where users can modify the grid directly,
add [special patterns](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2001-02/cellular-automata/walks%20of%20life/patterns.html),
adjust the iteration speed, and save/load the grid's state.
