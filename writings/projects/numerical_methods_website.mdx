# What is it?
While taking an engineering course on [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_method) back in February 2021,
I took the initiative to create a couple of interactive solvers using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
It was my first moderately complex React project. [Material UI](https://mui.com/) was used to simplify UI development.

It also supports matrix-based inputs:

# Mathematical Typesetting

In academic documents, [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) is a typesetting system often used to render mathematical formulae.
This website uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) to render custom TeX on the browser.
Based on user inputs, the website computes the numerical results of a specific algorithm and outputs them in TeX format rendered by KaTex.
<br />
<ParagraphIndent />[MathQuill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mathquill) is another library used to enable users to type mathematical formulae.

# Visualizations
In addition to mathematical rendering, the website also provides interactive graphs using the [Desmos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/desmos) graphing library.

# Site Tour
Using [React Joyride](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-joyride), users can view a tour of the different components of each solver.

# Conclusions
It was a pretty fun experience implementing the numerical algorithms learnt from the subject in Javascript while crafting user-friendly interfaces with React.
