# What is it?
Using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I attempted to create an interpreted language called Ari.
Given that it's my first attempt, I resorted to a **C-like grammar** due to its simplicity and ubiquity.

# Scanning
Scanning is the process of transforming the input program into a sequential array of tokens. [Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token) are the basic blocks of the program akin to physical atoms.
The block below illustrates the conversion:
```
+ ➡️ TokenType::Plus
; ➡️ TokenType::Semicolon
= ➡️ TokenType::Equal
== ➡️ TokenType::EqualEqual
123 ➡️ TokenType::Number
"123" ➡️ TokenType::String
someVariable ➡️ TokenType::Identifier
```

* The scanner's implementation can be found at [scanner.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/scanner.rs)
* All the tokens are defined at [token.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/token.rs)

# Parsing
Parsing is the process of creating an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) from the array of tokens.
Ari's AST comprises of three basic blocks:
* [Literals](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/ast.rs#L14) are values such as [numbers](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/number/), [strings](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/string/), [arrays](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/array/), [null](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/null/) etc.
* [Expressions](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/ast.rs#L415) are individual operations upon literals such as [arithmetic](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/number/#arithmetic), [comparisons](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/number/#logical-comparisons), [array access](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/array/#access), [variable assignment](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/variable/#assignment), [function call](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/function/) etc.
* [Statements](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/ast.rs#L114) are groups of expressions such as [if-else, loops](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/control_flow/), [function definitions](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/function/), etc.
<br />
<ParagraphIndent />For simplicity, Ari uses a manually-implemented [recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser).
Although easier than other parser types, it is vulnerable to stack overflow if the input program's recursion is too deep.
All statements and expressions are allocated on the **heap memory** using Rust's standard [Box](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html).

* The AST's implementation can be found at [ast.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/ast.rs)
* The parser's implementation can be found at [parser.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/parser.rs)

# Variables and Closures
In order to keep track of initialized variables, Ari uses Rust's standard [Hashmap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) to map the variables.
Moreover, Ari also implements **block scoping** which enables variable shadowing [described in the docs.](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/variable/#block-scoping-and-shadowing)
<br />
<ParagraphIndent />Ari's functions are [first class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function), meaning that they can be [stored in variables and passed around as arguments](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/function/#first-class-functions) to other functions.
Similar to Javascript, Ari implements the concept of [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) where functions keep a copy of their outer scope. [The docs provide some examples](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/function/#closures).

* The environment's implementation can be found at [environment.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/environment.rs)

# Array Operations
Ari creates and manipulates arrays using Rust's standard [Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html).
To **parallelize** array operations, [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) is used.
Array functions like [map, filter, reduce](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/array/#map) are also provided.

# Built-in Functions
No language would be appealing or useful if everything must be implemented from scratch.
Ari provides a small set of built-in functions that I think are helpful for [numbers](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/number/#built-in-functions), [strings](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/string/#built-in-functions), [arrays](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/array/#built-in-functions), [random numbers](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/builtin_functions/#random-generation), [file operations](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/builtin_functions/#file-operations) and [web stuff](https://fongyoong.github.io/ari-docs/features/builtin_functions/#web-stuff).
* The standard functions are implemented at [function.rs](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang/blob/master/ari_parser/src/function.rs)

# Error Reporting
Inspired by Rust, I incorporated terminal colors and helpful error messages which highlight **what** and **where** the errors are.

# Conclusions
This project was a good exposure to the intricacies of language design and also an exciting opportunity to put Rust into practice.
