# What is it?

Desktop GUIs built with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) seemed heavy on RAM and CPU so I wanted to try a lightweight alternative that had web standards built-in.
[Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) offered a lighter WebView-based implementation so I decided to try it out by building a downloader for YouTube video/audio/playlists from YouTube and other supported sites.
* The frontend is plain React with [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/) for the base component styles.
* The backend process makes use of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to do the heavy-lifting of downloading from YouTube.
    Using subprocesses, it forks multiple instances of yt-dlp to support concurrent downloads.
* It saves download history, provides selection of format and resolution, and supports download cancellation.
* There's also a system tray icon for fun.
* One big flaw currently is that there is not auto-update mechanism for the yt-dlp binary so it stops working after a while if not updated.
