This university group project demonstrated the practical use of visible light communication for indoor navigation.
It consisted of:
* An ESP32-based trolley which ran a combination of trilateration and Kalman filter algorithms to best estimate the trolley's location from light signals received from surrounding light transmitters.
* At least four light transmitters were required, each transmitter transmitting light at different toggling frequencies.
* A React Native modile app which paired with the trolley via Bluetooth and displayed the live positions in a 3D simulated view of the supermarket, rendered with Three.js
* A React web dashboard accessible to "admins" also utilized Three.js to display the live positions of all trolleys. The data were logged/stored in Firebase.
