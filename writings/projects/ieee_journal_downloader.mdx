# Background
As an electrical/electronics engineering undergrad, I often refer to [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) for research.
Although my university provides legal access to most of the research material,
I sometimes utilize shadier sources via [LibGen](https://libgen.is/scimag/) and [SciHub](https://sci-hub.se/) due to avoid the hassle of signing into my student account.
However, these two sources only allow access to one paper at a time and does not compile journals as a whole.
Out of curiousity, I decided to explore if it was possible to extract the metadata of a journal issue from the official IEEE site and acquire all the individual papers of the journal automatically, which led to this project.

# Website Reverse-Engineering
IEEE provides a [developer-friendly API](https://developer.ieee.org/Allowed_API_Uses) that is only available to organizations or anyone with an active subscription.
Obviously, anyone without a subscription cannot access the official API, which is a letdown.
I wanted to find a solution which sidesteps this limitation, so I monitored [network requests](https://github.com/FongYoong/ieee_journal_downloader/blob/master/misc/requests_tracking_data.txt) made by the IEEE website and found calls to publicly-exposed APIs which provided relevant information.
I also inspected the website's [unminified Angular code](https://github.com/FongYoong/ieee_journal_downloader/blob/master/misc/angular_main.js) and found even more interesting URLs.
As far as I'm aware, these APIs were undocumented and not meant for public use.

# Terminal Program
Using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I developed a cross-platform (tested on Windows and Linux only) terminal program which helps to download IEEE journal issues.

1) It uses these undocumented IEEE APIs to obtain metadata such as all the papers in a journal issue, their publication numbers and their corresponding [DOI](https://www.doi.org/).
2) The program sends the DOI to SciHub or LibGen and receives a HTML webpage containing the download link.
3) Using [scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper), a Rust library for scraping HTML documents, the program searches for the download link element and downloads the associated PDF document.
4) Given that each journal issue has a couple of papers, the Rust PDF library, [lopdf](https://github.com/J-F-Liu/lopdf), is used to merge the downloaded PDF documents into one final PDF.
