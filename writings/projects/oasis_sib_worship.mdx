# The Problem
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and country-wide lockdowns, [the church I was serving at](https://www.facebook.com/theoasissibs2/) resorted to [livestreaming](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOasisSIB) camera feeds to YouTube.
To enhance the experience, PowerPoint slides were superimposed onto the camera feeds using [chroma keying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key).

While sections like sermon points and announcements require reasonable time to prepare,
worship slides are the most **time-consuming and tedious** because song lyrics must be **manually** split into multiple slides.
A worship session typically covers 5 songs which, in my experience, are approximately equivalent to **100 slides or more**.

Another observation of mine was that while worship teams try to alternate between songs to keep the worship fresh, eventually songs are chosen and sung again in different Sundays.
This means duplicate work is done if the person-in-charge has to create slides for the song again in the future.
To summarize,
* Preparing worship slides is a tedious thing to do week in week out
* Songs get repeated once in a while, leading to duplicate work
* There's no centralized reference for worship songs in the church

# The Solution
The idea of using a website to address these issues appealed to me as a website is accessible to anyone with modern web browser and requires minimal setup.
Given that the target users possess tech literacy ranging from bare-minimum to competent, the website's [UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design) must be sufficiently intuitive to use.
This was an especially difficult challenge to tackle as I did not have much experience in UX design.
<br />
<ParagraphIndent />After 2 months of prototyping with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
the [website](http://oasis-sib-worship.vercel.app/) was viable enough in achieving its objectives.
The data was hosted on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) which offers a generous free tier for serverless [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/) databases.
Additionally, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) was used to interact with the database in a type-safe manner without cooking up raw SQL.

# Sessions
A session refers to a worship session for each Sunday. The **home page** displays all the sessions created in the past.

Each session contains info on the worship team roles, the order of songs, and additional info.

# Songs
Songs can be easily added by specifying their title, artist and most importantly, the lyrics.
By integrating [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) with some customizations of my own, adding song lyrics is quite straightforward similar to using Microsoft Word.
[Genius](https://genius.com/) is a company which specializes in song lyrics and provides an [API](https://docs.genius.com/) to search and fetch song lyrics.
Integrating this API enabled users to easily add song lyrics via Genius instead of copy-pasting manually.
It works perfectly for most songs with the exception of a few relatively unknown ones.
Another minor feature is automatically searching the song on YouTube and **embedding** the most relevant video in the song's page.

# Chord Annotations
I also built a chord annotator whereby users can specify chords for different parts of the lyrics. It was quite challenging to formulate an algorithm that played nicely with [Quill's Delta format](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/).

# PowerPoint Generation
The icing on the cake was the website's ability to **convert song lyrics to PowerPoint files**.
This was achieved by traversing the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) of the lyrics and dividing it according to [heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements).
Once the sections have been identified, the website translates them into a format suitable for [PptxGenJS](https://gitbrent.github.io/PptxGenJS/) which is a Javascript library for creating PowerPoint files. 
The code can be found at [/lib/powerpoint.tsx](https://github.com/FongYoong/oasis-sib-worship/blob/master/lib/powerpoint.tsx).
<br />
<ParagraphIndent />Additional settings are provided for users to tweak the **style** of the generated PowerPoint (font size, character spacing etc).
To simplify this process, I added a **preview section** which I found to be both cool and useful when customizing.

Other export types include **Microsoft Word**, **PDF** and **HTML**.

# Statistics
Based on feedback from church members, the [Stats](https://oasis-sib-worship.vercel.app/stats) page displays a ranking of songs ordered by the number of times they have been sung the past month or all time.
This helps worship leaders to determine which songs are often/rarely sung.

# Conclusions
* The website proved to be a fruitful endeavour which saved plenty of time.
* Handling database transactions were a breeze due to Prisma's straightforward ORM methods.
* Most of the effort was geared towards exporting lyrics to multiple formats and building a user-friendly interface.
